           <p>* Place the nuts in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade.<br>
        * Pulse until finely chopped but not pasty. <br>
          *  Transfer the nuts to a small dry skillet over medium heat;<br>
           * cook, stirring frequently, until the nuts are lightly browned and fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes.<br>
            * Pour the nuts into mixing bowl large enough to hold all of the ingredients, and set aside to cool. 
            * (Don't leave the nuts in the pan, as the residual heat may cause them to burn.)<br>
            * Place the onion, garlic, bell pepper, jalapeño pepper, and cilantro in the bowl of the food processor (no need to clean it first).
             * Pulse until the vegetables are finely minced but not puréed.<br>
             *  Set a fine sieve over a medium bowl.</p>

            <center> <div style="height: 40%; width: 60%;">
        * Transfer the minced vegetables to the sieve and use a rubber spatula to press out as much liquid as possible.
           *  Add the strained vegetable mixture to the bowl with the nuts.<br>
        * To the veggies and nuts, add the lamb, cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, salt, and white pepper.<br> 
          *  Using your hands, mash the mixture together until evenly combined.<br>
           * Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Form the mixture into patties about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick<br>
           * (they will puff up on the grill to look like meatballs).<br> 
             * Place on the baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap, then refrigerate until ready to cook.<br>
            * Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and oil the grates. Place the kofta on the grill and cook, covered, until browned, about 4 minutes per side or until cooked through. 
           * Serve with tzatziki and hummus.
